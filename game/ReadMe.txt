Controls:
Use RIGHT and LEFT arrow keys to move the monkey while it is on the air.
Use DOWN arrow key to send the monkey falling down with high speeds. 
	While the monkey is crashing down, the player will not be able to move it.
Goal:
Maximize how many bananas the monkey get by using the arrow keys to move the monkey
	in air.
Hitting a rock will send the monkey crashing downwards and deduct from his score.
Keep in mind that the monkeys will jump higher the more bananas obtained per jump
	as well as how far the monkey lands from the other.
Bugs:
Occassionally the jungle screen will not rend. 
Sprites don't render on Google Chrome.
